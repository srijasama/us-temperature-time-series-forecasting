# us-temperature-time-series-forecasting
Time-series forecasting of U.S. temperature trends (2000–2023) using ARIMA and ETS, with projections through 2029 and regression analysis of environmental indicators.
## 📈 Results

- ARIMA and ETS models were used to forecast temperature trends through 2029.
- Forecasts indicate gradual long-term warming patterns.
- Regression analysis suggests measurable relationships between CO₂ levels and temperature variation.
- Models demonstrate stable short-term fluctuations with upward long-term trajectory.
